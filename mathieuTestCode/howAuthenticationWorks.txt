User Registration:

When a user registers on your password manager website, generate a unique encryption key for that user.
Associate the encryption key with the user's email and password.
Store the hashed password and the associated encryption key in the database.
User Authentication:

When a user logs in, verify their identity by checking the entered password against the stored hashed password.
If the password is correct, retrieve the associated encryption key.
Encrypting and Decrypting Passwords:

Use the encryption key to encrypt the user's saved passwords before storing them in the database.
When the user wants to view their saved passwords, decrypt the stored encrypted passwords using the encryption key.

- We need to rebuild how users are authenticated because the libraries are broken and updated
